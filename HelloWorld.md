#Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Activity recognition is becoming easier as more people are wearing smartphones that can be used to collect and transmit information about their activity.  Since smartphones also have internet access they can be used to collect location and activity data and then transmit the information for analysis.  This may be especially useful in the healthcare industry for monitoring the growing population of elderly [1-3] or for monitoring the exercise patterns of people [4].  
The  data used in this project was generated by Samsung Smartphone accelerometers and the data were provided by Anguita et al. [1] and is available for downloading [5].  Activity information from a Samsung Smartphone was considered for individuals that were Walking, WalkingUpStairs, WalkingDownStairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying.  A training set of  data was fitted using four common models and then a validation and test subset were used to indicate which model most closely predicted the activity of an individual.  Once the model was selected it was then applied to a much larger subset from four individuals for validation.  Once validated the model was applied only once to the activities from the remaining 13 individuals within the complete assigned data set.
##Goal and Summary of Project:
1. Merge all data into a single data set, which has been called **samsungDataAll**.  It is in a “tidy” format, with the following characteristics: 10299 rows, and 563 columns, that starts with **Subject**, **Activity** (with 6 labeled levels), followed by 561 motion vectors.
2. Extract the mean and standard deviation for each measurement and create a data set with descriptive names, which has been called **samsungStatistics1**.  Its is the same as **samsungDataAll** except the number of columns was reduced to 81.  
3. An additional data set was created, named **samsungStatistics2**, which is identical to **samsungStatistics** except an additional 13 columns of mean data has been removed.  This data has been removed because they do not have matched standard deviations.
4. Finally, two summary data sets were created with the average of each variable.  These data sets are **summaryTable1** and  **summaryTable2**, and were summarized  from **samsungStatistics1** and **samsungStatistics2**, respectively.    

###Summary of tidy data sets      
File Name                     | Number of Columns        | Number of Rows     
:-----------------------------|:-------------------------:|:------------:
 **samsungDataAll**           |    563                    |     10299     
 **samsungStatistics1**       |      81                   |    10299    
 __samsungStatistics2*__      |        68                 |     10299     
 **summaryTable1**            |          81               |      180      
 __summaryTable2*__           |       68                  |    180    
__*These two files have matched means and standard deviations and are the most likely needed for the project, else the files with 81 columns also includes 13 additional means that are not matched with standard deviations.__

##Data    
Data was obtained from the following site: <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones> 
###Library used during the analysis
```{r}
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)
library(data.table)
library(car)
```

###Read Samsung phone test data sets from the R directory.
```{r}
xTest <- read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt")
subjectTest <- read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt")
activityTest <- read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt")
cNames <- read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt")
```
### transpose column names (also called features) from y- to x-asis
```{r}
names <- t(cNames)
```
## returns column names and selects row 2 with column names only
```
